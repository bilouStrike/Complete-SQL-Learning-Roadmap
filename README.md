This structured roadmap is designed to guide developers from beginners to intermediate learners through mastering SQL step by step.

It breaks down key concepts into three milestones: Fundamentals, Intermediate Concepts, and Advanced Techniques, each with focused units and hands-on exercises.

Whether you're aiming to improve your backend skills, work with databases, or prepare for technical interviews, this roadmap provides a clear and practical learning path.

A visual roadmap with progress tracking is also available to help you stay organized and motivated.

**Milestone 01: SQL Fundamentals**

Goal: Build a strong foundation in SQL by understanding relational databases, basic queries, and essential operations.

# Unit 01: Introduction to SQL and Databases

>Goal: Understand the basics of relational databases and SQL syntax.

* What is SQL and its importance
* Relational database concepts
* SQL data types and constraints
* Creating and dropping databases
* Creating and dropping tables
* Practical exercise: Create a simple database with multiple tables and define appropriate data types and constraints.

# Unit 02: Basic Data Manipulation

>Goal: Learn to insert, update, and delete data within tables.

* INSERT INTO statement
* UPDATE statement
* DELETE statement
* TRUNCATE vs DELETE
* Practical exercise: Populate your tables with sample data and perform update and delete operations.

# Unit 03: Simple Queries and Filtering

>Goal: Retrieve data using SELECT statements with various clauses.

* SELECT statement basics
* WHERE clause for filtering
* Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
* Comparison operators (=, <>, >, <, BETWEEN, IN, LIKE)
* ORDER BY clause
* Practical exercise: Write queries to retrieve specific data based on conditions and sort the results.

# Unit 04: Functions and Expressions

>Goal: Utilize built-in SQL functions for data processing.

* Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
* String functions (UPPER, LOWER, LENGTH, SUBSTRING)
* Date functions (NOW, DATE\_PART, AGE)
* Mathematical functions (ROUND, CEIL, FLOOR)
* Practical exercise: Apply various functions to manipulate and analyze data in your tables.

**Milestone 02: Intermediate SQL Concepts**

Goal: Enhance your SQL skills by learning about joins, subqueries, and data grouping techniques.

# Unit 01: Joining Tables

>Goal: Combine data from multiple tables using different types of joins.

* INNER JOIN
* LEFT (OUTER) JOIN
* RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN
* FULL (OUTER) JOIN
* CROSS JOIN
* Practical exercise: Write queries that join multiple tables to retrieve comprehensive datasets.

# Unit 02: Grouping and Aggregating Data

>Goal: Summarize data using GROUP BY and HAVING clauses.

* GROUP BY clause
* HAVING clause for filtering groups
* Combining GROUP BY with aggregate functions
* Practical exercise: Generate summary reports, such as total sales per region or average scores per class.

# Unit 03: Subqueries and Nested Queries

>Goal: Use subqueries to perform complex data retrievals.

* Subqueries in SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses
* Correlated vs non-correlated subqueries
* EXISTS and NOT EXISTS operators
* Practical exercise: Create queries that utilize subqueries to filter and compute data.

# Unit 04: Set Operations and Views

>Goal: Perform operations on multiple query results and create virtual tables.

* UNION and UNION ALL
* INTERSECT
* EXCEPT
* Creating and managing views
* Practical exercise: Combine results from different queries and create views for simplified data access.

**Milestone 03: Advanced SQL Techniques**

Goal: Master advanced SQL features, including indexing, transactions, and performance optimization.

# Unit 01: Indexing and Performance Tuning

>Goal: Improve query performance through indexing and analysis.

* Understanding indexes and their types
* Creating and dropping indexes
* Analyzing query performance with EXPLAIN
* Optimizing queries for better performance
* Practical exercise: Add indexes to your tables and compare query performance before and after indexing.

# Unit 02: Transactions and Concurrency Control

>Goal: Manage data integrity and consistency using transactions.

* ACID properties
* BEGIN, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK statements
* Isolation levels (READ COMMITTED, SERIALIZABLE, etc.)
* Handling concurrent transactions
* Practical exercise: Implement transactions to ensure data consistency during complex operations.

# Unit 03: Stored Procedures and Triggers

>Goal: Automate tasks and enforce rules using procedural SQL.

* Creating and executing stored procedures
* Creating and managing triggers
* Use cases for procedures and triggers
* Practical exercise: Develop stored procedures and triggers to automate data validation and logging.

# Unit 04: Advanced Query Techniques

>Goal: Explore complex query constructs for sophisticated data analysis.

* Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
* Recursive queries
* Window functions (ROW\_NUMBER, RANK, LEAD, LAG)
* Pivoting data
* Practical exercise: Write advanced queries using CTEs and window functions to analyze data trends.
